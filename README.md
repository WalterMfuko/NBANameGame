NBA Name Game
A web-based name game that tests your knowledge of NBA players. This interactive game challenges players to name NBA players following specific rules based on player names.
How to Play

The game automatically starts with a randomly selected NBA player name
Players take turns entering NBA player names
Each new name must follow these rules:

The first letter of the new player's first name must match the first letter of the previous player's last name
For example:

If the last player was "Mitch Richmond"
The next player must start with "R" (like "Roy Hibbert")
Then the next player must start with "H" (like "Horace Grant")
And so on...
